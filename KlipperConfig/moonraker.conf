[power bluer]
type: shelly
#   The type of device.  Can be either gpio, tplink_smartplug, tasmota
#   shelly, homeseer, homeassistant, or loxonev1.
#   This parameter must be provided.
off_when_shutdown: False
#   If set to True the device will be powered off when Klipper enters
#   the "shutdown" state.  This option applies to all device types.
#   The default is False.
locked_while_printing: False
#   If True, locks the device so that the power cannot be changed while the
#   printer is printing. This is useful to avert an accidental shutdown to
#   the printer's power.  The default is False.
restart_klipper_when_powered: False
#   If set to True, Moonraker will issue a "FIRMWARE_RESTART" to Klipper
#   after the device has been powered on.  The default is False, thus no
#   attempt to made to restart Klipper after power on.
restart_delay: 1.
#   If "restart_klipper_when_powered" is set, this option specifies the amount
#   of time (in seconds) to delay the restart.  Default is 1 second.

user:
password:
output_id: 0
timer:
#   The above options are used for "shelly" devices.  The
#   address should be a valid ip or hostname for the Shelly device.
#   Provide a user and password if configured in Shelly (default is empty).
#   If password is set but user is empty the default user "admin" will be used
#   Provided an output_id (relay id) if the Shelly device supports
#   more than one (default is 0). When timer option is used to delay the turn
#   off make sure to set the state to "on" in action call_remote_method.
#   So we send a command to turn it on for x sec when its already on then
#   it turns off.

[timelapse]
enabled: True
##   If this set to False the Gcode macros are ignored and
##   the autorender is disabled at the end of the print.
##   The idea is to disable the plugin by default and only activate 
##   it during runtime via the http endpoint if a timelapse is desired.
autorender: True
##   If this is set to False, the autorender is disabled at the end of the print.
constant_rate_factor: 10
##   The range of the CRF scale is 0–51, where 0 is lossless,
##   23 is the default, and 51 is worst quality possible. 
##   A lower value generally leads to higher quality, and a 
##   subjectively sane range is 17–28.
